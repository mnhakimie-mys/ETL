# Weather Data Pipeline

This project is an automated weather data pipeline built using **Python** and **PostgreSQL**. It collects live weather information from the **OpenWeatherMap API** for major Malaysian cities every 15 minutes, cleans and transforms the data, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.  

The processed data can then be visualized in **Power BI**, showing temperature, humidity, and weather condition trends across Malaysia.
